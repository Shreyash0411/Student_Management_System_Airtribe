JIT Compiler vs Interpreter

Interpreter : 
The interpreter reads the bytecode line by line and convert it to the 
machine code on the fly 
once the machine code is ready it executes it immediately

It is good for small programs, and programs that only runs once,
as it has a very fast startup

but for the repeated code it is very slow
for example recursive functions, loop and multiple time same mmethod calls
because of this it has to execute the same code again and again


JIT Compiler [JIT Compiler]
It detects those part of the codes that are running multiple times the program
and compile those together in bytecode and native machine code
Stores the memory and runs directly

it is much faster than the interpreter, as it eliminates the repeated 
execution of the code,
the entire code is executed all together rather than it being line by line
it is slow and time taking process as the compilation takes time
