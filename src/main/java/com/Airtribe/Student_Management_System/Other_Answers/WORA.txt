Write Once and Run Everywhere

Java application follow the concept of Write Once and Run Everywhere
this means that once the app is devloped it becomes platform independent
and can run on any sort of Platform without any external adjustment.

This is possible because of JVM
unlike other languages where once the program are compiled, they are 
converted to the code that can be understood by the platform only so for another
platform to run that program it needs to be compiled and some minor 
adjustments are required before running into new platform,

JAVA does something different, it converts the code into bytecode
or machine code which is then interpreted by the JVM
so once the JAVA programs are compiled into generates the bytecode which
can be run anywhere as long as the machine as JVM installed in it
