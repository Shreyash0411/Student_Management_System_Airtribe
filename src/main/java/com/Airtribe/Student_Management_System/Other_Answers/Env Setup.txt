after downloading the jdk from the oracle website 
i installed it in my C Drive 
by following the basic steps of setting up the location of install and giving the 
permit

once the installation, i decided to setup the env variable 

Enviroment Variable Setup

Step => 1 to setup the env variable, you can just search enviroment variable 
in the window search, and an edit enviromment variable option will appear

Step => 2 click on the enviroment variable button at the bottom,

Step => in both the user and system variable you can click new 
where a minor dialog will appear, 

Step 4 => setup the variable name as JAVA_HOME
Step 5 => Setup the Variable value as "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23", as this is 
the location where my jdk is installed 

once done click on applly

Open terminal 
and write the command 
java -version

if the env is setup correctly it will show you the version number of the jdk installed
else you might need to recheck the variable setup
